# Auto Frontmatter

自动添加元数据

这是我在学习 Obsidian 插件开发的过程中写的一个简单的插件，用于自动添加元数据到笔记中，方便用Hugo生成静态博客站点。

其实就是在[alangrainger/obsidian-frontmatter-modified-date](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-frontmatter-modified-date )的基础上改了一下。

## Contributing

To make changes to this plugin, first ensure you have the dependencies installed.

```
npm install
```

### Development

To start building the plugin with what mode enabled run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

_Note: If you haven't already installed the hot-reload-plugin you'll be prompted to. You need to enable that plugin in your obsidian vault before hot-reloading will start. You might need to refresh your plugin list for it to show up._

### Releasing

To start a release build run the following command:

```
npm run build
```
